# Project Phase 2 <br>
  For phase 2 we continued on our phase 1 but decided to do a couple of changes to our project. Going forward, we will be using NBA data that also includes statistical measures for calculating the performance of a player. We will still be using social media from twitter but we figured finding a data set that also included statistical measurement including performance metrics would help us better analyze a players performance versus their social media popularity<br>
  
  ## NBA Players and Stats <br>

We will be adding this dataset, more specifically the sets from advanced statistics (https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_advanced.html) as it allows us to check statistical measurements of a players performance. These measurements are known as BPM (Box Plus/Minus, VORP (Value over Replacement Player) among others. Like the other data we have, cleaning and EDA will be performed on it. <br>

Used scrapy to get the new data from the advanced table of basketball-reference. This data spanned from 1995 - 2020. Cleaned this data, and then performed EDA on it to see patterns in the data, specifically on the BPM, True Shot Percentage, and other key data columns.
